Hiya! This is a webapp designed to help an indecisive person (like me oops) figure out what game they'd like to play.
Finding a game is easy! You either drop in a year between 1972 and 2023, or hit the random button at the top, and the app will pull a random game from a list of games that released in that year!
It will pull the name, a picture (if available, otherwise it uses a default provided by Giant Bomb), the platforms the game released on, and a short description (if available).
Don't like the look of the game? Refresh and try again!
